        summary: |
            Currently a full-time student at West Chester University. After an Associateâ€™s Degree in Business
            Administration from Northampton Community College, I transferred to West Chester and changed my
            major to Computer Science. I am interested in learning about how the software development process
            works in real world situations and very interested in learning more about both front and back end development.
