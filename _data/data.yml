    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Currently full-time Student at West Chester University. After an Associate's Degree in Business 
      Administration from Northampton Community College, I transferred to West Chester to pursue
      a Bachelors Degree in Mathematics with a concentration in Business. After two semesters
      pursuing this I found myself becoming more and more uninterested in the math theory. While
      business and math are still two of my greatest passions I was not finding satisfaction with
      the course work. At the same time I was finding myself spending more time doing extra work
      for my computer science classes I was taking as electives. This lead me to change my major
      to Computer Science and delve deep into my studies.
