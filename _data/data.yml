        title: Career Profile
        summary: |
            Currently full-time Student at West Chester University. After an Associate's Degree in Business 
            Administration from Northampton Community College, I transferred to West Chester to pursue
            a Bachelors Degree in Mathematics with a concentration in Business. After two semesters
            pursuing this I found myself becoming more and more uninterested in the math theory. While
            business and math are still two of my greatest passions I was not finding satisfaction with
            the course work. At the same time I was finding myself spending more time doing extra work
            for my computer science classes I was taking as electives. This lead me to change my major
            to Computer Science and delve deeper into my studies.

# Main education
educationcomplete:

        - degree: Associates in Arts, Business Administration
          university: Northampton Community College, Bethlehem, PA
          time: 2017 - 2019
          details: My plan going into college was to get my MBA. During my time at Northampton Community College, 
           I went from my favorite classes being my business classes to them becoming my least favorite classes.
           Even with this mindset becoming ever more prevalent, I pressed on and got my Associate’s degree in 
           Business Administration. During this time, I got accepted to West Chester University and had to choose
           what my major was going to be. I had the choice between economics finance and math finance. Liking my
           business classes less by the day, I chose math because it was less business and more working with numbers and crunching data.

        - degree: Bachelor of Science, Mathematics - Mathematical Finance Concentration
          university: West Chester University, West Chester, PA
          time: 2019 - 2020
          details: After transferring to West Chester University and starting classes, I was liking the math theory
           classes that I was taking and was even enjoying the advanced finance classes. I was liking them so much
           that I even joined the Investment Club where I met a great group of people that I really got along with
           and did great work with. As one semester turned to another the math theory classes were starting to feel
           more and more like doing math to do math. This led me to start disliking the classes and start procrastinating
           doing the homework by doing extra work for my computer science electives. After my second semester
           as a math student and in completing West Chester University’s computer science II course. I realized
           that if I was doing so much work in my computer science classes and loving it then I should just switch majors.

        - degree: Bachelor of Science, Computer Science
          university: West Chester University, West Chester, PA
          time: 2020 - current
          details: So, I changed my major and dove headfirst into my studies. Changing my major this late in my 
            college career has led to packed semesters, having classes like Data Structures and Algos and its 
            prerequisite at the same time. While this is fine for me because of all of the work that I have done out
            of the classroom, it has led to me having classes with both freshmen and seniors at the same time. At 
            first, I was annoyed because I felt behind. When I thought about it more I realized that it just allows 
            me to help teach the new students and help guide their start to higher education. One of my favorite 
            things with online classes has been the active discord servers for each class. I feel that it gives 
            students a place and easily accessible way to ask questions to the professor or other students. Helping
            other students figure out how to solve their questions by nudging them in the right direction without 
            giving them the answer has been a fun challenge, a good way to reinforce course material, a good test
            of my written communication skills, and very satisfying when I see them have their eureka moment.
